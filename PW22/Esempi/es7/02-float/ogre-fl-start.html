            <h1><a href="#nogo">THE OGRE COURTING.</a></h1>
            
            <p id="par1"><img src="shrek.png" alt="ogre img"> days when ogres were still the terror of certain districts, there was
            one who had long kept a whole neighbourhood in fear without any one daring
            to dispute his tyranny. By thefts and exactions, by heavy ransoms from merchants too old and
            tough to be eaten, in one way and another, the Ogre had become very rich;
            and although those who knew could tell of huge cellars full of gold and
            jewels, and yards and barns groaning with the weight of stolen goods, the
            richer he grew the more anxious and covetous he became. Moreover, day by
            day, he added to his stores; for though <span>(like most ogres)</span> he was as stupid
            as he was strong, no one had ever been found, by force or fraud, to get the
            better of him.</p>
        
            <p id="par2">What he took from the people was not their heaviest grievance. Even to be
            killed and eaten by him was not the chance they thought of most. A man can
            die but once; and if he is a sailor, a shark may eat him, which is not so
            much better than being devoured by an ogre. No, that was not the worst. The
            worst was this&mdash;he would keep getting married. And as he liked little
            wives, all the short women lived in fear and dread. And as his wives always
            died very soon, he was constantly courting fresh ones.</p>
        
            <p id="par3">Some said he ate his wives; some said he tormented, and others, that he
            only worked them to death. Everybody knew it was not a desirable match, and
            yet there was not a father who dare refuse his daughter if she were asked
            for. The Ogre only cared for two things in a woman&mdash;he liked her to be
            little, and a good housewife.</p>
        
            <p id="par4">Now it was when the Ogre had just lost his twenty-fourth wife (within the
            memory of man) that these two qualities were eminently united in the person
            of the smallest and most notable woman of the district, the daughter of a
            certain poor farmer. He was so poor that he could not afford properly to
            dower his daughter, who had in consequence remained single beyond her first
            youth. Everybody felt sure that Managing Molly must now be married to the
            Ogre. The tall girls stretched themselves till they looked like maypoles,
            and said, "Poor thing!" The slatterns gossiped from house to house, the
            heels of their shoes clacking as they went, and cried that this was what
            came of being too thrifty.</p>
        
            <p id="par5">And sure enough, in due time, the giant widower came to the farmer as he
            was in the field looking over his crops, and proposed for Molly there and
            then. The farmer was so much put out that he did not know what he said in
            reply, either when he was saying it, or afterwards, when his friends asked
            about it. But he remembered that the Ogre had invited himself to sup at the
            farm that day week.</p>
        
            <p>Managing Molly did not distress herself at the news.</p>
        
            <p>"Do what I bid you, and say as I say," said she to her father, "and if
            the Ogre does not change his mind, at any rate you shall not come
            empty-handed out of the business."</p>
        
            <p>By his daughter's desire the farmer now procured a large number of hares,
            and a barrel of white wine, which expenses completely emptied his slender
            stocking, and on the day of the Ogre's visit, she made a delicious and
            savoury stew with the hares in the biggest pickling tub, and the wine-barrel
            was set on a bench near the table.</p>
        
            <p>When the Ogre came, Molly served up the stew, and the Ogre sat down to
            sup, his head just touching the kitchen rafters. The stew was perfect, and
            there was plenty of it. For what Molly and her father ate was hardly to be
            counted in the tubful. The Ogre was very much pleased, and said
            politely:</p>
        
            <p>"I'm afraid, my dear, that you have been put to great trouble and expense
            on my account, I have a large appetite, and like to sup well."</p>
        
            <p>"Don't mention it, sir," said Molly. "The fewer rats the more corn. How
            do <i>you</i> cook them?"</p>
        
            <p>"Not one of all the extravagant hussies I have had as wives ever cooked
            them at all," said the Ogre; and he thought to himself, "Such a stew out of
            rats! What frugality! What a housewife!"</p>
        
            <p>When he broached the wine, he was no less pleased, for it was of the
            best.</p>
        
            <p>"This, at any rate, must have cost you a great deal, neighbour," said he,
            drinking the farmer's health as Molly left the room.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know that rotten apples could be better used," said the farmer;
            "but I leave all that to Molly. Do you brew at home?"</p>
        
            <p>"We give <i>our</i> rotten apples to the pigs," growled the Ogre. "But
            things will be better ordered when she is my wife."</p>
        
            <p>The Ogre was now in great haste to conclude the match, and asked what
            dowry the farmer would give his daughter.</p>
        
            <p>"I should never dream of giving a dowry with Molly," said the farmer,
            boldly. "Whoever gets her, gets dowry enough. On the contrary, I shall
            expect a good round sum from the man who deprives me of her. Our wealthiest
            farmer is just widowed, and therefore sure to be in a hurry for marriage. He
            has an eye to the main chance, and would not grudge to pay well for such a
            wife, I'll warrant."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm no churl myself," said the Ogre, who was anxious to secure his
            thrifty bride at any price; and he named a large sum of money, thinking, "We
            shall live on rats henceforward, and the beef and mutton will soon cover the
            dowry."</p>
        
            <p>"Double that, and we'll see," said the farmer, stoutly.</p>
        
            <p>But the Ogre became angry, and cried; "What are you thinking of, man? Who
            is to hinder my carrying your lass off, without 'with your leave' or 'by
            your leave,' dowry or none?"</p>
        
            <p>"How little you know her!" said the farmer. "She is so firm that she
            would be cut to pieces sooner than give you any benefit of her thrift,
            unless you dealt fairly in the matter."</p>
        
            <p>"Well, well," said the Ogre, "let us meet each other." And he named a sum
            larger than he at first proposed, and less than the farmer had asked. This
            the farmer agreed to, as it was enough to make him prosperous for life.</p>
        
            <p>"Bring it in a sack to-morrow morning," said he to the Ogre, "and then
            you can speak to Molly; she's gone to bed now."</p>
        
            <p>The next morning, accordingly, the Ogre appeared, carrying the dowry in a
            sack, and Molly came to meet him.</p>
        
            <p>"There are two things," said she, "I would ask of any lover of mine: a
            new farmhouse, built as I should direct, with a view to economy; and a
            feather-bed of fresh goose feathers, filled when the old woman plucks her
            geese. If I don't sleep well, I cannot work well."</p>
        
            <p>"That is better than asking for finery," thought the Ogre; "and after all
            the house will be my own." So, to save the expense of labour, he built it
            himself, and worked hard, day after day, under Molly's orders, till winter
            came. Then it was finished.</p>
        
            <p>"Now for the feather-bed," said Molly. "I'll sew up the ticking, and when
            the old woman plucks her geese, I'll let you know."</p>
        
            <p>When it snows, they say the old woman up yonder is plucking her geese,
            and so at the first snowstorm Molly sent for the Ogre.</p>
        
            <p>"Now you see the feathers falling," said she, "so fill the bed."</p>
        
            <p>"How am I to catch them?" cried the Ogre.</p>
        
            <p>"Stupid! don't you see them lying there in a heap?" cried Molly; "get a
            shovel, and set to work."</p>
        
            <p>The Ogre accordingly carried in shovelfuls of snow to the bed, but as it
            melted as fast as he put it in, his labour never seemed done. Towards night
            the room got so cold that the snow would not melt, and now the bed was soon
            filled.</p>
        
            <p>Molly hastily covered it with sheets and blankets, and said: "Pray rest
            here to-night, and tell me if the bed is not comfort itself. To-morrow we
            will be married."</p>
        
            <p>So the tired Ogre lay down on the bed he had filled, but, do what he
            would, he could not get warm.</p>
        
            <p>"The sheets must be damp," said he, and in the morning he woke with such
            horrible pains in his bones that he could hardly move, and half the bed had
            melted away. "It's no use," he groaned, "she's a very managing woman, but to
            sleep on such a bed would be the death of me." And he went off home as
            quickly as he could, before Managing Molly could call upon him to be
            married; for she was so managing that he was more than half afraid of her
            already.</p>
        
            <p>When Molly found that he had gone, she sent the farmer after him.</p>
        
            <p>"What does he want?" cried the Ogre, when they told him the farmer was at
            the door.</p>
        
            <p>"He says the bride is waiting for you," was the reply.</p>
        
            <p>"Tell him I'm too ill to be married," said the Ogre.</p>
        
            <p>But the messenger soon returned:</p>
        
            <p>"He says she wants to know what you will give her to make up for the
            disappointment."</p>
        
            <p>"She's got the dowry, and the farm, and the feather-bed," groaned the
            Ogre; "what more does she want?"</p>
        
            <p>But again the messenger returned:</p>
        
            <p>"She says you've pressed the feather-bed flat, and she wants some more
            goose feathers."</p>
        
            <p>"There are geese enough in the yard," yelled the Ogre, "Let him drive
            them home; and if he has another word to say, put him down to roast."</p>
        
            <p>The farmer, who overheard this order, lost no time in taking his leave,
            and as he passed through the yard he drove home as fine a flock of geese as
            you will see on a common.</p>
        
            <p>It is said that the Ogre never recovered from the effects of sleeping on
            the old woman's goose feathers, and was less powerful than before.</p>
        
            <p>As for Managing Molly, being now well dowered, she had no lack of offers
            of marriage, and was soon mated to her mind.</p>
